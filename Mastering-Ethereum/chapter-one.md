## Mastering Ethereum - Chapter 1

Given that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is turing complete, the machine is at risk of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks due to non-terminating programs. For this reason, gas was introduced to meter the computation of a program's execution. A transaction must specify an upper gas limit when interacting with a contract. If the computation exceeds this limit, the execution is terminated.
