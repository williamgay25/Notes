# Course Introduction

Internet: large dataset (graph). webpages are the nodes and links the edges.

7 +/- 2: The number of items the average human can hold in working memory

Our goal is to distill a large data set into 7 useful insights. 

Two Approachs for Big Data Analytics:
1. Data Mining:
    - Automatic
    - Summarization / Classification
    - >Millions of items

2. Human-Computer Interaction
    - User-driven
    - Interaction / Visualization
    - Thousands of items

Our Research will combine the best of both. Computation + Human Intuition.

Data & Visual Analytics are used to help people make discoveries or gain insights from a data set.

We are in the era of big data and this is not slowing down.

Some of the building blocks can be skipped or readdressed. Each of these parts is a two-way street and serves as a general guide / pieces to make progress on a dataset.
